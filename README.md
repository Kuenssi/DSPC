A little calculator for Dyson Sphere Program.

Future Additions/Fix planed:

- [ ] Fix Hydrogen/Refined Oil
- [ ] Overview over how much smelter/assembler... needed
- [ ] Rework ResultTree
- [ ] Icons for Buildings/Components
- [ ] Fix Water
- [ ] Tool Tipps while hovering over icons (as soon as those are added)
- [ ] Add empty buttons to building and component table for empty slots

Adrian's wish: 
Add possibility for every needed building being without numbers behind the beautiful decimal point
