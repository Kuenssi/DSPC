A little calculator for Dyson Sphere Program.

Future Additions/Fix planned:

- Overview over how much smelter/assembler... needed
- Rework ResultTree
- Icons for Buildings/Components
- Tool Tips while hovering over icons (as soon as those are added)
- Add empty buttons to building and component table for empty slots

Adrian's wish: 
Add possibility for every needed building being without numbers behind the beautiful decimal point
